# TestingGitFeatures
I made this repo for testing git features such as Actions, Projects, Insight etc.

### Projects
Projects are the equivalent to epics. Projects will consist of many issues, which can be a part of many milestones.

### Issues
Issues specify direct changes that need to be made on the system. Issues can be marked as open or closed, they have a milestone associated with it (sprint), and you can create branch directly off of it.

### Milestones
Mile stones are sprints. They have a title, description, and a due date.
